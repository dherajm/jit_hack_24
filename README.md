We are building a comprehensive one stop platform connecting farmers, buyers and equipment owners for optimal crop pricing and assured crop buyers, while providing access to essential tools and machinery to enhance agricultural productivity and profitability.

## Features 

1. Provide a platform for farmers to rent the required Machinery at that particular phase of farming from Machinery Providers. 
For example, during the crop harvest, the farmer will decide to rent a Harvester Machinery. He'll post a request on our application, all the nearby Harvester owners associated with our platform will recieve a notification of the farmer's request. The interested machinery owners can accept the request and rent his or her machinery.
(This feature will be similar to how we book either a cab or an auto on either OLA or UBER)

2) Secondly, the playform provides an platform for Buyers(Companies) associated with our platform a forum to post their crop demand request. The farmers who are in on our platform can access the forum board (read-only) to accept the request issued by the Buyer. If the farmer is interested, he or she will enter a fair contract governed by our platform and supply them the crop. The price of the crop will be decided prior the contract. 
This feature will gradually decrease the rate of farmer losses.
